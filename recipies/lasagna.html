    <p>are a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types,[2] made of very wide, flat sheets. Either term can also
        refer to an Italian dish made of stacked layers of lasagne alternating with fillings such as ragù (ground meats
        and tomato sauce), vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella, and parmesan), and seasonings and
        spices, like Italian seasoning, such as garlic, oregano and basil.[3] The dish may be topped with grated cheese,
        which becomes melted after baking. Typically cooked pasta is assembled with the other ingredients and then baked
        in an oven. The resulting baked pasta is cut into single-serving square portions.</p>
    <h2>Ingridients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound sweet Italian sausage</li>
        <li>3/4 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1/2 cup minced onion</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste</li>>
        <li> 2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce</li>>
        <li> ½ cup water</li>>
        <li> 2 tablespoons white sugar</li>>
        <li> ½ teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>>
        <li> ½ teaspoon fennel seeds</li>>
        <li> 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
        <li> ½ teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste</li>>
        <li> ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>>
        <li> 4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>>
        <li> 12 lasagna noodles</li>>
        <li> 16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>>
        <li> 1 egg</li>>
        <li> ¾ pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>>
        <li> ¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>>

    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1</li>
        <p>
        In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned. Stir in
        crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian
        seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring
        occasionally.</p>>

        <li>Step 2</li>
        <p>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes.
        Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley,
        and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</p>>

        <li>Step 3</li>
        <p>
        Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>>

        <li>Step 4</li>
        <p>
        To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles
        lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella
        cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat
        layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either
        spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</p>>

        <li>Step 5</li>
        <p>
        Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes
        before serving.</p>>
