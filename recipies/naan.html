    <p>Naan (Hindi: नान,Persian: نان, romanized: nān, Urdu: نان, Pashto: نان Dari: نان, Bengali: নান) is a leavened,
        oven-baked or tawa-fried flatbread which is found in the cuisines mainly of Western Asia, Central Asia, Indian
        subcontinent, Indonesia, Myanmar, and the Caribbean.</p>
    <h2>Ingridients</h2>
    <ul><li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 cup warm water</li>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons milk</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>4 ½ cups bread flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic (Optional)</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter, melted</li></ul>
    <h2>steps</h2>
    <ol><li>Step 1</li>
        Dissolve yeast in warm water in a large bowl. Let stand about 10 minutes, until frothy.
        
        <li>Step 2</li>
        Meanwhile, generously oil a large bowl.
        
        <li>Step 3</li>
        Stir sugar, milk, egg, and salt into the yeast mixture. Mix in enough flour to make a soft dough.
        
        <li>Step 4</li>
        Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth, 6 to 8 minutes.
        
        <li>Step 5</li>
        Place dough in the prepared oil, cover with a damp cloth, and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
        
       <li> Step 6</li>
        Punch down dough on a lightly floured surface, and knead in garlic. Pinch off small handfuls of dough about the size of a golf ball; you should have about 14. Roll each piece into a ball and place on a tray. Cover with a towel, and allow to rise until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.
        
        <li>Step 7</li>
        Meanwhile, preheat a large grill pan over high heat.
        
        <li>Step 8</li>
        Roll each piece of dough into a thin circle.
        
        <li>Step 9</li>
        Brush some melted butter on the preheated grill pan. Place a few pieces of dough in the pan (as many as you can fit) and cook until puffy and lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Brush butter onto the uncooked sides, flip, and cook until browned, 2 to 4 more minutes. Remove from the grill and repeat to cook the remaining naan.</ol>
