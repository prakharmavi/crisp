    <p>A samosa is a fried or baked pastry with a savory filling, including ingredients such as spiced potatoes, onions,
        peas. It may take different forms, including triangular, cone, or half-moon shapes, depending on the
        region.Samosas are often accompanied by chutney, and have origins in medieval times or earlier.Samosas are a
        popular entrée, appetizer, or snack in the cuisines of South Asia, the Middle East, Central Asia, East Africa
        and their diasporas.

        The English word samosa derives from Hindi word 'samosa' (Hindi: समोसा), traceable to the Middle Persian word
        sanbosag (سنبوسگ) 'triangular pastry'.Similar pastries are called sambusak in Arabic; Medieval Arabic recipe
        books sometimes spell it sambusaj.The spelling samoosa is used in South Africa.</p>

    <ul>
       <li> 2 cups all-purpose flour </li>
       <li> ½ teaspoon salt </li>
       <li> 2 tablespoons butter </li>
       <li> ¼ cup water </li>
       <li> 1 quart oil for deep frying </li>
       <li> 2 tablespoons butter </li>
       <li> 1 small onion, chopped </li>
       <li> 2 cloves garlic, chopped </li>
       <li> 2 green chile peppers, chopped</li>
       <li> 1 tablespoon fresh ginger root, chopped </li>
       <li> ½ teaspoon ground turmeric </li>
       <li> ½ teaspoon chili powder </li>
       <li> ¾ pound ground lamb </li>
       <li> 1 teaspoon salt </li>
       <li> 2 teaspoons garam masala </li>
       <li> 1 ½ tablespoons fresh lemon juice </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1</li>
        In a medium bowl, mix flour, salt and butter until the mixture resembles fine bread crumbs. Pour in water, using more (up to approximately 1/4 cup) if necessary to make a smooth dough. Pat into a ball. Place on a lightly floured surface and knead 10 minutes, or until dough is smooth and elastic. Return to the bowl, cover and set aside.

        <li>Step 2</li>
        Heat oil in a large, deep skillet to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

        <li>Step 3</li>
        Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium high heat. Stir in onion, garlic, green chile peppers and ginger. Cook 5 minutes, or until onions are golden brown. Stir in turmeric, chili powder, ground lamb and salt. Cook until the lamb meat is evenly brown, about 10 minutes. Stir in garam masala and lemon juice. Continue cooking 5 minutes, then remove from heat.

        <li>Step 4</li>
        Divide dough into 15 equal portions. Roll portions into balls, then flatten into 4 inch circles. Cut each circle in half. Dampen edges and form semicircles into cones. Fill cones with equal portions of the lamb meat mixture. Dampen top and bottom edges of cones, and pinch to seal.

        <li>Step 5</li>
        Carefully lower cones into preheated oil a few at a time. Fry until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Serve warm.
